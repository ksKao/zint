# Zint

**Zint** is a local-only desktop budget tracker built with **Tauri** and **React**. I created this app because I couldn’t find a free alternative that offered a customizable dashboard for personal budgeting—and because I’m not nearly good enough with Microsoft Excel to build polished charts with proper data aggregation.

Zint focuses on privacy, flexibility, and simplicity, giving you full control over your financial data without relying on the cloud.

## Features

1. **Customizable dashboard**: Fully customizable dashboards with five different widget types, allowing you to see your spending at a glance.

2. **Local-only storage**: Your data belongs to you. All information is stored locally on your device — no external servers involved.

3. **Optional Google Drive backup**: Backup your app data to Google Drive and restore it anytime, entirely optional.

4. **Excel import & export**: Import existing budgeting spreadsheets from Excel or export your data when needed.

5. **Multi-account support**: Create and manage multiple bank accounts within Zint. Each account has its own dashboard and isolated data, making it easy to track separate budgets.
